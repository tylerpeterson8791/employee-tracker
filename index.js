/*
FIX EXIT APPLICATION.  Don't know how to do that???

Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

Update employee managers.

View employees by manager.

View employees by department.

Delete departments, roles, and employees.

View the total utilized budget of a departmentâ€”in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.

Maybe import queries (especially view employee) instead of consting them in?
